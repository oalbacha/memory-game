//Start by building a very simple grid of cards.
//Don't worry about styling, just get something clickable on the page.
//Figure out the HTML needed to represent a card. Remember, you have to represent two sides of the card. Are you going to have two //separate elements stacked on top of each other?
//Add the functionality to handle clicks.
//This should reveal the hidden side of each card.
//Work on the matching logic. How does your game "know" if a player guesses correctly or incorrectly?
//Work on the winning condition. How does your game “know” if a player has won?
//We recommend saving styling until the very end. Allow your game logic and functionality to dictate the styling.

//Get the card to flip on click
//flip another card 
//Add comparison logic between the two flipped cards. if they match they stay flipped and if the don’t they reset to unflipped
